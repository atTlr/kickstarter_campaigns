    "The primary purpose of this project is to attempt to compile a comprehensive analysis of publicly available Kickstarter datasets with the goal to provide visualizations of the data as well as a machine learning model that will predict and give a probability of if the campaign will be successful. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will incorporate the python libraries pandas, numpy, and matplotlib for the Data Cleaning and Data Visualization steps of the project. Sklearn will be the library used for the machine learning model. We will be utilizing Amazon Web Services (AWS) to run and return our fitted model. A logistic regression will be used for the explanatory model while a random forest classifier will be used for a more predictive model. Natural Language Processing will additionally be used as further exogenous variables within our modeling pipeline as a way to incorporate the title and description of the Kickstarter Campaign as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis will also incorporate current articles that have been pubished by Kickstarter themselves as 'best practices' for running a campaign. We will look to corroborate any of these 'best practices' if they can be shown through the data as well as provide our own reccomendations based on our model."

    "Before conducting the analysis, we find that it is neccessary to explain some of the facts nuances in the Kickstarter crowdfunding platform. The two main nuances that set Kickstarter apart from other plateforms are that Kickstarter does not offer a 'flexible' funding option and that Kickstarter only recieves money from a campaign if said campaign reachs its goals. For the US, kickstarter applies a 3-5% fee for credit card and PayPal processing, and take 5% for any successfully funded campaign. (https://www.kickstarter.com/articles/creative-projects-community-covid-19). This creates a unique situation as Kickstarter is incentivezed to help to cultivate and assist its campaign creators to reach the goals that it has set. When a campaign does not reach its chosen goal, no funds/pledges are collected or given to the creator by Kickstarter. As stated before this is markedly different from other platforms which offer 'flexible' funding options. Flexible funding options allow any funds that were pledge towards a goal to be collected by the creator with the caveat that any funds under the sepecified goal have a high percentage taken out by the crowdfunding comapny. \n",
    "\n",
    "Becuase of these nuances, Kickstarter has published via their blogs, different strategies and practices on what they see as actions taken by campaigns according to their data. According to Kickstarters stat page, Around 38% of all campaigns reach their goal (https://www.kickstarter.com/help/stats?ref=global-footer) this means that a few percentage points less than 2/3rds of all campaigns do not reach their goal. Interestingly, out of the 5.2 billion dollars requested by all campaigns launched on the site, 4.73 billion dollars have been collected by successfully funded projects. This could either indicate that the projects that get funded more often are campaigns with high goals or that campaigns that are successfully funded are often backed far above the suggested goal. "

We have included a notebook that has the full process of the data cleaning and merging of datasets. Both datasets were cleared of any duplicates based on the campaign unique ID. This ensured that there was no overlap between the data sets gathered. There were several columns that were cleaned such as the 'name' and 'category' columns and the 'launched' and 'deadline' columns were adjusted to be datatime objects. Kickstarters stats page says that there have been 497,000 projects. Our dataset in total after cleaning and deleting duplicates round out to be around the 380,000 range. The time period of our data is from 2009 to July of 2020. While our data dies not capture every single campiagn we do believe that it is representative of the campaign population as a whole."

Whereas success was relatively even across the duration earlier, now we can clearly see that 30 days and less have a high percentage of successful campaigns. AT around 2 months, there is clearly a low point. Based on the evidence and suggestions given by Kickstarter, generally campaigns that are more successful are better planned from the beginning which have the clearly defined outline and are marketed well. Longer campaigns may suffer from lack of coordination and clear plan and probably rely on having a loger deadline to be a crutch to getting more funding. "

    "One topic that we often found that was not discussed, was the topic of how category influences success. Kickstarter clearly focuses on the idea of 'projects' and does not allow crowdfunding of medical or personal campaigns that are not directly tied with a business campaign or personal artistic/technology based campaign. This will inherently shape the type of demographics that frequent and back the site. Kickstarters data found that projects are not purely or even mostly funded by friends and family but rather people who are independent of the creators circle. While the categories are organized from larget to cmallest in terms of number of campaigns, this does not also suggest that the more common campaigns are the most succesfful. The most successful campiagn categories based on percentages are: comics, theater, dance, and music. the music category is the only category that would be considered a 'main' or 'large' category on the website. Technology, journalism, fashion, and food are the lowest categories upon visual inspection. "
